System Monitoring and Alerting Tool
This project is a Python-based system monitoring and alerting tool designed to keep track of various system metrics in real-time. It monitors key resources such as CPU, memory, disk usage, temperature, and GPU stats, and alerts when any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Tracks CPU, memory, disk usage, network stats, system uptime, temperature, and GPU statistics.
Threshold Alerts: Set customizable thresholds for CPU, memory, disk usage, and temperature. Alerts are triggered when these thresholds are exceeded.
Process Monitoring: Allows the monitoring of specific processes (by name or PID) for CPU and memory usage. Alerts are triggered if a process exceeds its defined resource limits.
Detailed Logs: Provides a detailed log of system performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, network usage, and process information.
Customizable: Easily configure the thresholds and processes you want to monitor.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-monitoring-tool.git
cd system-monitoring-tool
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install psutil GPUtil
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python monitor.py
Configuration
You can configure various thresholds for system metrics in the GENERAL_THRESHOLDS dictionary and specific processes in the PROCESS_THRESHOLDS dictionary. Modify these values to suit your system's requirements.

python
Copy code
GENERAL_THRESHOLDS = {
    "cpu": 80,
    "memory": 80,
    "disk": 90,
    "temperature": 80,
    "gpu": 80,
    "gpu_memory": 80,
}

PROCESS_THRESHOLDS = {
    "python": {
        "cpu": 50,
        "memory": 60,
    },
    "chrome": {
        "cpu": 70,
        "memory": 80,
    },
}
Usage
The tool runs continuously and monitors your system's performance. Alerts will be displayed in the terminal when thresholds are exceeded. You can stop the monitoring by pressing Ctrl+C.
